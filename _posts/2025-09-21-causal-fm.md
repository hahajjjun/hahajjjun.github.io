### Randomized experiments and average treatment effect(ATE)
Consider a dataset $\mathcal{D}$, containing $n$ tuples $(X,Y,A)$: $X$ be the covariates, $Y$ be the outcome, and $A \in \{0,1\}$ be the treatment variable. We assume that

1) The data is sampled i.i.d from joint distribution $\mathbb{P}$ over $(X,Y,A)$
2) $Y(a) \perp A$, for $a=0,1$
3) $\mathbb{P}(A=a)=\pi_a>0$, for $a=0,1$, and propesnity score $\pi_a$ is known.

Under these assumptions, we aim to estimate average treatment effect(ATE):
$$\theta = \mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0)] = \mathbb{E}[Y|A=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y|A=0]$$

Standard approach is to estimate $\theta$ using difference in means (DM) estimator:
$$\hat{\theta}_{DM} = \frac{1}{n_1} \sum_{i;A_i=1} {Y_i} - \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{i;A_i=0} {Y_i}$$, where
$n_i$ denotes the number of data samples with $A_i=a$.
